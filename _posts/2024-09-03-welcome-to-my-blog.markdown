Welcome to my blog, I'm Li Bochen, born in Tangshan, Hebei Province, China. Graduated from Hebei Normal University with
a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering in 2024.

I worked as a software engineer at Bosch and Neusoft. Currently, I am in charge of technical support for ManageEngine products in Zoho.

I have a variety of hobbies, such as astronomical observation, listening to music, photography and traveling.

I will share my life on this website and look forward to your visit!
