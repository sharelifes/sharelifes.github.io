Welcome to my blog, I'm Li Bochen, born in Tangshan, Hebei Province, China. Graduated from Hebei Normal University with
a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering in 2024.

I used to intern in Bosch. At present, I am working in the Neusoft “Energy and Civil Aviation Division - Production and
Operation Development Center - Smart IoT Development Team” team as a software engineer.

I have a variety of hobbies, such as astronomical observation, listening to music, photography, and traveling.
Especially, in order to have a better understanding of astronomy, I have met many astronomy enthusiasts and astronomers.

I will share my life on this website and look forward to your visit!
