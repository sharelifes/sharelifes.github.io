# Getting Help

Missing some documentation? Or got stuck developing your plugin? See all the ways of obtaining support below for each case.

Please use English in all communication.

## Problems with the Guide

If you're having problems with the guide itself, such as missing, incorrect, or confusing content, please raise an issue on YouTrack. If the problem is easily solved, you can also submit a Pull Request.

If you want to report (smaller) issues for a specific page, you can also use the **Was this page helpful?** feedback form on the bottom of each page by providing more details after clicking the **No** button. Please try to be as specific as possible and provide your e-mail address for further questions and getting notified of updates.

If you just want to share feedback on the guide, again, raise an issue, even if it's for a discussion, ideas on improvements or suggestions.

> Please don't use the **IJSDK** YouTrack project for plugin or product support requests - it's intended for the SDK and the documentation, and you'll get a better response using one of the methods below.

## Problems with Code - Support Issues

> Please see Plugin Development FAQ and Explore the IntelliJ Platform API for tips & tricks.

For questions and problems related to plugin development itself (rather than the content of this guide), you have several options:

- #intellij-platform on JetBrains Platform Slack - this chat room is a great place to ask questions about extending JetBrains products, with answers coming from both JetBrains team members and members of the community
- Plugin Development Forum - post a message to the support forum. It is regularly updated with answers by JetBrains team members.

Of course, all raised questions will be used to try and improve this guide.

## Problems with Products

If you have a problem with an IntelliJ Platform-based product, such as IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, Rider, etc., please use any of the regular Product Support channels.
